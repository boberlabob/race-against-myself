## 🚀 **Development Workflow for Next Session**

### **Quick Start Checklist**
1. **Verify current functionality**: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. **Check GPS calibration** and track loading
3. **Test race start/stop cycle** with existing tracks
4. **Review browser console** for any errors
5. **Identify the highest impact issue** from roadmap

### **Recommended Session Focus**

#### **If GPS Issues Reported:**
→ Start with **Performance & Reliability** section
- Implement GPS accuracy filtering
- Add signal quality indicators
- Test race stability improvements

#### **If Core Features Missing:**
→ Focus on **Enhanced Racing Features**
- Implement segment timing
- Add pause/resume functionality  
- Enhance finish detection

#### **If Analytics Requested:**
→ Work on **Data & Analytics**

## 📋 **Known Issues & Technical Debt**

### **Performance Issues**
- **GPS jumping**: Occasional position jumps cause incorrect race metrics
- **Memory growth**: Long races may cause memory usage to increase significantly
- **Battery drain**: Continuous GPS polling reduces device battery life

### **UX Issues**  
- **Finish detection**: Sometimes fails to detect race completion properly
- **Audio timing**: Motivational messages can overlap or interrupt
- **Error states**: Some error conditions don't provide clear user guidance

### **Code Quality**
- **Some debug logging**: Still active in production code
- **Magic numbers**: GPS accuracy thresholds and timeouts should be configurable
- **Error handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across modules
